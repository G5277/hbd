            Happy Birthday.
A very very happy birthday to you. 

You know what, I know that birthdays or any such days don't matter to you much, but to me they do.  And your birthday is a veryyy veryyy special something for me. 

And you dumbasss, you know how much I love you, I love you so much, so so so very much. Remember this, always.

And, it's not your birthday everyday, and it's your first birthday with me, so here is something extra special for you.

 ----
Since the day I've met you or have even started working with you, say in my language,  since the day you have started to exist in my world, you've someone interesting to me. Someone who I was always able to just talk to. Someone who just understood me, understood what I meant, what I felt to a lot greater extent that anyone has ever did before. 
The wayy you suggested me movies, series, books, ooof it was always interesting.
The wayy you mentioned that I was adorable, ooof, it did something to me. Or maybe it just started to do something in me. 
Everytime I talked to you, it felt like something was happening, like you were capturing a part of me with you, and leaving a part of yourself to always be in me.
You started to be a special someone in my life. 
Slowly and slowly, it was like, you were becoming the someone I constantly craved to talk to, someone I just wanted around me.
Even when I had a lot other people with me, 
You felt like the someone I would want to be with all the time, the someone I would want to talk to all the time. You started affecting me.
I thought I was not affected by people easily, and here we we this certain someone who was just doing it so that easily, without even knowing, without even trying.
You made me fall in love with you. Slowly and slowly, day by day, you made the love grow, and till date, you continue doing it. 


The way, you are so tuff and strong and hard to break, and at the same time on the inside you are such a sweet and cute guy.
Like how you can easily handle someone like me, take care of me, listen to my tantrums, my drama, and at the same time be such a romantic, talking and making me feel something warm inside. 
Ah, talking about inside, how you let me tease you and at the same time ooof, the wayy you make me want every part of you,
I love you my bachcha,
I love you a lot for everything, for all you are, for all you do, just for everything.

You bring me peace my love, the kinda peace I didn't know existed. The kinda peace maybe a part of me always craved for. 
Your warm touches, your kisses, you just looking at me, patting my head, and all these little sweet gestures that you show, the just warm my part, they just melt me.
And ooof, the hugs.
How can someone forget about those. 
Pure. Heaven. 
Aren't they?
How I can just forget everything and be there with you, listening to your heart beat, such a calming effect it has.
( Remember, the next time you don't understand how to deal me with, just make me sit and hug me, let me listen to your heart beat. It will calm me down )

Okay, so there is something I didn't tell you. The day I properly hugged you with me sitting and you standing, I realised, your heart beat calmed me down. And I thought maybe this sound in general calms me down.
So, I came back and tested it and realised,
I was wrong. 
It's you my love, my bachcha. It's you whose beating heart has that calming effect on me.
It's you who can handle me, in every way I am.
Every imperfection I have. 
Everything that's bad about me,
It's you who has a weird way of just calming me down and making me feel this comfortable.

Yes, there are lot of times I still struggle, and maybe you can't handle me at those, but your presence makes a huge difference.
If you don't know it, know it from now, that you just being there by my side, makes a huge difference for me.
It makes me just feel that it's okay, even if things go wrong there is someone to hold on to, there is something to hold on to. 
You are that something for me.
My heart just knows that even when there won't be anything, you'd be there by my side. 

Maybe I have just started to get addicted to you. A lot addicted to you.
People say addiction is bad, but I like this addiction, I don't mind this addiction. I don't mind me, my body, my mind craving your presence. 
Craving that little not so little hand of yours just being there on my thighs whenever I sit.
It just has a warm presence saying that I belong. I belong here, I belong to you.

You know what I have rarely felt that I belong. Everywhere there have been times that I felt me being here or not will not make much of a difference. Be it home, my friend groups, society, pr anything in general. Like, it has always been so easy to just not be a part. But with you it feels like that it is somewhere I belong, somewhere I matter. 

I love you my bachcha, I love you a lot a lot, bht sara bht sara, and I can not even imagine not being with you or losing you.
You saw that day, you just mentioning of leaving me, what it did to me, it just hurts me, hurts me to even think about that possibility, it makes me wanna cry, just break down, it makes my heart ache for real.
That is how much I am addicted to you, your presence, and that is how much I love you.
I hope you just remember that.

Now just tell me, today was the day that you came to life, the day my peace finally started his journey of being with me, how can this day not be special, not be something that I'd be waiting for. 

It is and will be one of the most special days for me, okay?
And said that, once again my love, a very happy birthday, and I hope I'm there with you to wish you for a lot many more years, till the day I'm not old enough that I'm not even able to say a word to you properly, I want to be with you, I want to keep celebrating such silly days and enjoying life.

I hope reading this, atleast got a cutu si smile to your face, ( and if not, I hope you smile now) cuz your this cutieeee si smile nn, warms my heart even more, just looking at you smile makes me wanna smile and I'm smiling even now, just thinking that you might smile when you read this.


Ooooff, kitna likhti hu mai, issokayyyyy,

Yours,
Wifeyy~
